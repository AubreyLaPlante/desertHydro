Description: The desertHydro watershed model simulates the surface and shallow 
  subsurface flow from an input rainfall event. The primary flow routing algorithm 
  is modified from a Soil Moisture Routing (SMR) algorithm. The user
  inputs a digital elevation model (DEM), watershed boundary, (shapefile), 
  soil characteristics, and precipitation data. 
  The model outputs stacked tif files with each timestep as a layer including
  velocity, soil moisture, and surface depth. Optionally, these stacked rasters can
  be converted into gifs for visual aids. 
  Note - This is still in early stages of development.
